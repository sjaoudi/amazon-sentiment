The entire program is in amazon.py.
Sklearn, numpy, and matplotlib should be the only required external libraries.

The complete dataset is not included, but can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
It should be renamed "all-reviews.csv", although it's very large, so 1,000 and
10,000 review subsets are included. Uncomment the desired csv file at
the bottom of amazon.py.

The method "runClassifiers" will run all classifiers listed in the self.classifiers
variable on the categories in the PreProcessing class initializer on line 29.

The "gridSearch" method can also be run with different classifiers and parameters.
